Response: (It seems like Michael is having a pretty typical day. He's going about his routine of work, chores, and rest. Perhaps you could ask him about his job and what he does for work. Or maybe he's taking some online courses?  Or maybe he's working on a side project?  It could be interesting to explore his hobbies or interests. Maybe he plays video games or reads books.  You could also ask him about his family, his plans for the evening, or what he's looking forward to.  Based on his activities, I'd say a question about work or hobbies would be relevant.)
